=          Design           =
=============================
In the classes Locker and SpaceShip i choose to creat a LongTermStorage object,
because each locker need to be related to one long term object so items will pass their while needed.
each spaceship has a long therm storage so this why i choose to do like so.

I choose to creat two class SortByProximity, SortByRating their both implement the interface
Comparator of hotel objects, either one of them implements the method compare of hotel objects, according
to different characteristic.

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
I choose to the class locker the methods moveToLong that check if items need to move to the long term storage.
and the method checkConstraint the finds if two items can be in the same locker.

I choose to implement the method getHotelsInCityByRating using the method compare of class sortByRating.
at first i select only he hotels that in the given city, and then sorting them according to their rating withe
bubble sort, and using the method compare of class sortByRating.
For the test of this method i choose to use the file hotels dataset.txt because it has hotel from different
cites.

To implement the methods getHotelsByProximit, getHotelsInCityByProximity i created the class sortByProximity
and use bubble sort and the method compare of that class.
For the test of this methods i choose to use both of the given files because one has hotel from different
cites so i could see that i gives only hotels in specific city, and with the other one i cloud check that
even if the hotels close ti each other it still works.
