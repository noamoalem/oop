=          Design           =
=============================
I choose to implement the SpaceShip class as a abstract class, and the different types of spaceships are
sub-classes of the SpaceShip class.
I choose to do the SpaceShip class abstract because the game does not include a "regular" spaceship (so we
dont need to creat "regular" spaceship object, and this class can be abstract).
Each spaceship has it own characteristics, but still all of the spaceships has something in common
(like the ability to fire, teleport, put shield, the energy counter and more).
The behavior of each spaceship during the game is different, so i decided to make the doAction method of
each one of the spaceships different, but all of the common action that take place in every round (like the
current energy that goes up) for all of the different spaceships i put in the doAction of the super class
and they all uses that.

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
To the class SpaceShip i choose to add the methods shieldOff - in order to remove the shield while needed,
and checkDistanceIsSmaller - because in a several different classes i wan needed to check if the distance
between two spaceships is smaller then a given units number.

=============================
- The drunkard spaceship behavior i choose to implement is that this ship will always accelerate, when it
gets closer to another spaceship by 0.20 units, it randomly do one of 6 action: do nothing, turn right,
turn left, teleport, fire or put the shield on, according to random number.

- To the special spaceship implementation i choose the character of spongebob, and the shield is spongebob
pineapple house.
The behavior i choose to do is that it constantly turn left so it seems like he hover in space.
when it gets closer to another spaceship by 0.25 units, he feels threatened it put the shield on
(go inside his house) for 40 rounds, fire and turn away from the other spaceship.
